<a href="http://jameswen.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Personal Site</a>
-------

This is my personal site intended to better portray my personal background and experiences. Also, who doesn't like having a virtual home on the web?

The site presents a description about my current background and experiences, my previously taken and current courses, and introductions to my personal, class, and hackathon projects.
